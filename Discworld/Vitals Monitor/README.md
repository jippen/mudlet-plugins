Discworld Bottomgraphs
======================

This is a fairly simple little script that adds graphs to the bottom of your mudlet window, updating your health, gp, and xp.

It also updates whenever you send input to the mud, to try to keep the graphs as accurate as possible.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Just download the xml file and import it into mudlet.

Tested on Mudlet 2.0-beta4
